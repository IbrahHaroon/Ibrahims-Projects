        <p>This project is a tool used to graph two different products next to eachother
            in order to compare their sizes. It's original purpose was to compare computer cases
            in order to see if they could store different sizes of components inside. It utilizes 
            Python's Beautiful Soup library in order to webscrape a given link to then graph. This 
            project was inspired by a website called comparesizes.com which serves the same function.
